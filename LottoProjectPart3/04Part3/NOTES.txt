Worked like crazy on this one. I have the data being saved and the 're-use data' working to allow the user to click a button and automatically enter the saved numbers into the Text Fields.

I need some help with the 'view' data entered. It is not showing when the user requests it but the numbers can be re-entered. Not sure what I have done wrong but need to stop working and rest now, 12 hours on d trot is enough for me..

It is nowhere near finished but tried to get a head-start on it to allow us time to complete it soon and work on our other projects.

See what you think guys and let me know if you have any suggestions how to fix the bad 'links' I have made in the Event Handling.
